Project brief
Background context 

The GenAI Consulting team at BCG has been approached by a leading global financial institution, Global Finance Corp. (GFC), to address a pressing challenge in their operations. GFC, amid a rapidly evolving financial landscape, is seeking to enhance its capabilities in analyzing corporate financial performance. They have identified a need for a sophisticated, AI-driven solution to stay ahead in the market and provide their clients with deeper, more accessible insights into corporate financial health.

GFC's traditional methods of financial analysis, though reliable, have become time-consuming and less efficient in the face of increasing data volumes and the fast pace of financial markets. They are looking to BCG, known for its cutting-edge AI solutions, to develop a tool that can quickly analyze and interpret large sets of financial data, specifically from 10-K and 10-Q reports.

The project 

Your role as a junior data scientist in the GenAI Consulting team is pivotal in developing an AI-powered chatbot that can analyze and provide insights on corporate financial performance from 10-K and 10-Q financial documents. This chatbot is intended to revolutionize the way GFC and its clients interact with financial data, making complex information easily accessible and understandable through conversational AI.

Key terms

10-K and 10-Q reports: Annual and quarterly financial reports filed by publicly traded companies containing detailed information about financial performance.
GenAI: A branch of AI focusing on generating new content, including text and data analysis, which is crucial for the chatbot's ability to interpret and communicate financial data.
Natural language processing (NLP): An AI technology that the chatbot will use to understand and respond to user queries in natural language.
 
Specific project requirements and outcomes

Efficiency: The solution must significantly reduce the time taken to analyze financial documents compared to traditional methods.
Accuracy: The chatbot should provide precise and reliable financial insights backed by thorough data analysis.
User-friendly interface: The chatbot should be intuitive and easy to use for GFC’s diverse client base, regardless of their financial expertise.
Scalability: The solution should be scalable – capable of handling an increasing number of documents and user queries.
The pressure is high, as GFC is looking to implement this solution in the upcoming financial quarter. The GenAI Consulting team is feeling a mix of excitement and urgency, understanding the impact this project could have on their reputation and future opportunities. As a junior data scientist, you are expected to bring fresh perspectives and innovative solutions, working under the guidance of your manager, Aisha, to meet these high expectations. The team is geared up for a challenging yet rewarding journey, aiming to deliver a groundbreaking tool in the field of financial analytics.
